      <p>
        I’m always immersed in the world of technology, whether it’s diving into
        the latest tech new, working on coding projects, or exploring new tech
        trends. Music is my constant companion while I code, and my interest in
        politics adds a layer of depth to my understanding of the tech
        industry’s impact on society. These passions keep me motivated and
        engaged every day.
